# TestCentricityWeb

The TestCentricityâ„¢ core generic framework for desktop and mobile web site testing implements a Page Object and Data Object Model DSL for
use with Cucumber, Capybara, and selenium-webdriver. It supports testing against locally hosted desktop browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari,
IE, or Edge), locally hosted emulated iOS and Android mobile browsers (using Firefox), a "headless" browser (using Poltergeist and PhantomJS),
or on cloud hosted desktop or mobile web browsers using the BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, or CrossBrowserTesting services.


## Installation

Add this line to your automation project's Gemfile:

    gem 'testcentricity_web'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install testcentricity_web


## Setup
###Using Cucumber

If you are using Cucumber, you need to require the following in your *env.rb* file:

    require 'capybara'
    require 'capybara/cucumber'
    require 'testcentricity_web'
    
    
###Using RSpec

If you are using RSpec instead, you need to require the following in your *env.rb* file:

    require 'capybara'
    require 'capybara/rspec'
    require 'testcentricity_web'
    
    
###Selenium WebDriver

If you choose to not connect to selenium-webdriver using the ***WebDriverConnect.initialize_web_driver*** method, or if you need to directly
call methods in selenium-webdriver, you will also need to require the following in your *env.rb* file:

    require 'selenium-webdriver'



##Usage

### Page Objects

The **Page Object Model** is a test automation pattern that aims to create an abstraction of your web app's User Interface that can be used
in tests. A **Page Object** is an object that represents a single page in your AUT (Application Under Test). **Page Objects** encapsulate the
implementation details of a web page and expose an API that supports interaction with, and validation of UI elements on the page.

**Page Objects** makes it easier to maintain automated tests, because changes to page UI elements are only changed in one location - in the
**Page Object** class definition. By adopting a **Page Object Model**, Cucumber Feature files and step definitions are no longer required to
hold specific information about a page's UI objects, thus minimizing maintenance requirements. If any element on a page changes (URL path,
text field attributes, button captions, etc.), maintenance is performed in the **Page Object** class definition only, typically with no need
to update the affected feature file, scenarios, or step definitions.


####Defining a Page Object

Your **Page Object** class definitions should be contained within individual *.rb* files in the ***features/support/pages*** folder of your
test automation project. You define new **Page Objects** as shown below:

    class LoginPage < TestCentricity::PageObject
      trait(:page_name)       { 'Login' }
      trait(:page_url)        { "/sign_in" }
      trait(:page_locator)    { "//body[@class='login-body']" }
    end


    class HomePage < TestCentricity::PageObject
      trait(:page_name)       { 'Home' }
      trait(:page_url)        { "/dashboard" }
      trait(:page_locator)    { "//body[@class='dashboard']" }
    end


####Adding UI Elements to your Page Object

**UI Elements** are added to your **Page Object** class definition as shown below:

    class LoginPage < TestCentricity::PageObject
      trait(:page_name)       { 'Login' }
      trait(:page_url)        { "/sign_in" }
      trait(:page_locator)    { "//body[@class='login-body']" }
    
      # Login page UI elements
      textfield :user_id_field,        "userName"
      textfield :password_field,       "password"
      button    :login_button,         "//input[@id='submit_button']"
      checkbox  :remember_checkbox,    "rememberUser']"
      label     :error_message_label,  'div#statusBar.login-error'
    end
    
Once your **Page Objects** have been instantiated, you can interact with the **UI Elements** in your **Page Objects**. An example is shown
below:

    login_page.user_id_field.set('snicklefritz')
    login_page.password_field.set('Pa55w0rd')
    login_page.login_button.click


####Adding Methods to your Page Object

It is good practice for your Cucumber step definitions to call high level methods in your your **Page Object** instead of directly accessing
and interacting with a page object's UI elements. You can add high level methods to your **Page Object** class definition for interacting with
the UI to hide implementation details, as shown below:

    class LoginPage < TestCentricity::PageObject
      trait(:page_name)       { 'Login' }
      trait(:page_url)        { "/sign_in" }
      trait(:page_locator)    { "//body[@class='login-body']" }
    
      # Login page UI elements
      textfield :user_id_field,        "userName"
      textfield :password_field,       "password"
      button    :login_button,         "//input[@id='submit_button']"
      checkbox  :remember_checkbox,    "rememberUser']"
      label     :error_message_label,  'div#statusBar.login-error'
    
      def login(user_id, password)
        user_id_field.set(user_id)
        password_field.set(password)
        login_button.click
      end

      def remember_me(state)
        remember_checkbox.set_checkbox_state(state)
      end
    end


Once your **Page Objects** have been instantiated, you can call your methods as shown below:

    login_page.remember_me(true)
    login_page.user_id_field.set('snicklefritz', 'Pa55w0rd')
    


### PageSection Objects

A **PageSection Object** is a collection of **UI Elements** that may appear in multiple locations on a page, or on multiple pages in a web
app. It is a collection of **UI Elements** that represent a conceptual area of functionality, like a navigation bar, a search capability,
or a menu. **UI Elements** and functional behavior are confined to the scope of a **PageSection Object**.

A **PageSection Object** may contain other **PageSection Objects**.


####Defining a PageSection Object

Your **PageSection** class definitions should be contained within individual *.rb* files in the ***features/support/sections*** folder of
your test automation project. You define new **PageSection Objects** as shown below:

    class SearchForm < TestCentricity::PageSection
      trait(:section_locator)    { "//form[@id='gnav-search']" }
    end


####Adding UI Elements to your PageSection Object

**UI Elements** are added to your **PageSection** class definition as shown below:

    class SearchForm < TestCentricity::PageSection
      trait(:section_locator)    { "//form[@id='gnav-search']" }
        
      # Search Form UI elements
      textfield :search_field,   "//input[@id='search-query']"
      button    :search_button,  "//button[@type='submit']"
    end


####Adding Methods to your PageSection Object

You can add high level methods to your **PageSection** class definition, as shown below:

    class SearchForm < TestCentricity::PageSection
      trait(:section_locator)    { "//form[@id='gnav-search']" }
        
      # Search Form UI elements
      textfield :search_field,   "//input[@id='search-query']"
      button    :search_button,  "//button[@type='submit']"

      def search_for(value)
        search_field.set(value)
        search_button.click
      end
    end


####Adding PageSection Objects to your Page Object

You add a **PageSection Object** to its associated **Page Object** as shown below:

    class HomePage < TestCentricity::PageObject
      trait(:page_name)       { 'Home' }
      trait(:page_url)        { "/dashboard" }
      trait(:page_locator)    { "//body[@class='dashboard']" }
      
      # Home page Section Objects
      section :search_form, SearchForm
    end

Once your **Page Object** has been instantiated, you can call its **PageSection** methods as shown below:

    home_page.search_form.search_for('ocarina')
    
    

###Instantiating your Page Objects

Before you can call the methods in your **Page Objects** and **PageSection Objects**, you must instantiate the **Page Objects** of your
web application, as well as create instance variables which can be used when calling a **Page Objects** methods from your step definitions.
There are several ways to instantiate your **Page Objects**.

One common implementation is shown below:

    module WorldPages
      def login_page
        @login_page ||= LoginPage.new
      end
    
      def home_page
        @home_page ||= HomePage.new
      end
    
      def registration_page
        @registration_page ||= RegistrationPage.new
      end
    end
        
    World(WorldPages)

The **WorldPages** module above can be defined in your *env.rb* file, or you can define it in a separate *world_pages.rb* file in the
***features/support*** folder.

While this approach is effective for small web applications with only a few pages (and hence few **Page Objects**), it quickly becomes
cumbersome to manage if your web application has dozens of **Page Objects** that need to be instantiated and managed.

####Using the PageManager

The **PageManager** class provides methods for supporting the instantiation and management of **Page Objects**. In the code example below,
the **page_objects** method contains a hash table of your **Page Object** instance variables and their associated **Page Object** classes
to be instantiated by **PageManager**:
    
    module WorldPages
      def page_objects
        { :login_page                 => LoginPage,
          :home_page                  => HomePage,
          :registration_page          => RegistrationPage,
          :products_grid_page         => ProductsCollectionPage,
          :product_detail_page        => ProductDetailPage,
          :shopping_basket_page       => ShoppingBasketPage,
          :payment_method_page        => PaymentMethodPage,
          :confirm_purchase_page      => PurchaseConfirmationPage,
          :my_account_page            => MyAccountPage,
          :my_order_history_page      => MyOrderHistoryPage,
          :my_ship_to_addresses_page  => MyShipToAddressesPage
        }
      end
    end
    
    World(WorldPages)
    
The **WorldPages** module above should be defined in the *world_pages.rb* file in the ***features/support*** folder.

Include the code below in your *env.rb* file to ensure that your **Page Objects** are instantiated before your Cucumber scenarios are
executed:
    
    include WorldPages
    WorldPages.instantiate_page_objects
