# TestcentricityWeb

The TestCentricityâ„¢ core generic framework for desktop and responsive mobile web site testing implements a Page Object 
and Data Object Model DSL, for use with Capybara and selenium-webdriver. It supports testing against locally hosted
desktop browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE, or Edge), locally hosted emulated mobile browsers (using Firefox), or 
on cloud hosted browsers using the BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, or CrossBrowserTesting services.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'testcentricity_web'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install testcentricity_web


## Setup

If you are using Cucumber, you must require the following in your env.rb file:

    require 'capybara/cucumber'
    require 'testcentricity_web'
    
If you choose to not connect to WebDriver using the ***WebDriverConnect.initialize_web_driver*** method, or if you need to 
directly call methods in selenium-webdriver, you will also need to require the following in your env.rb file:

    require 'selenium-webdriver'
